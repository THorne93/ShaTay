So on my quest to locate the perfect chip I am prepared to suffer through the mountains of soggy shit, the piles of unsatisfactory treats or overly salty 'tables. So, our story begins on a sunny day in Granada. Myself and 3 workmates had just finished a riveting training session on how to text English and we were famished. I had heard of a bar (actually I had been there multiple times before, but I didn't say that) that serves banging chicken wings. The bar in question: Taberna Nico, situated on a street just off of Pedro Antonio. It's a nice place. Well... Dirty but also dirty cheap - €1 for half a litre of beer - and we sat down, ordered beer and wings, and waited. This is not about beer, nor is it about wings. It's about chips. And here they are. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/20180223_1402471.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Not bad, eh? So, on to the criteria... All rated out of 5 Crispyness - 2 Kind of disappointing, but I assume that the cook was rushed for time and so had to adjust accordingly. Flavour - 4 Strong showing in this department, I thoroughly enjoyed the taste of these potatoey treats, no idea why, maybe the oil? Texture - 3 Kind of soggy in places, neither hard nor soft or fluffy. Smell - 3 Smells like chips Condiments - 4 Two decadent sauces were available, bbq and alioli. Very nice. Seasoning - 2 Did have some salt. Would like to have seen some pepper or perhaps Cajun seasoning. Temperature - 4 Were very recently cooked and was pleasantly warning to the stomach. Overall, I would rate these chips 3/5 as, whilst they have a very pleasant flavour, I feel that it was somewhat lacking in the looks and texture department. Thank you "

              "__cdata": " <i>I'm a sucker for French fries, I love that they're salty! - Megan Hilty</i> Our next chapter takes us to the sleepy (stabby) neighborhood of Chana. Trying out some new tapas bars is also a risky business and this bar in particular seemed to want to kill me with raw fish. The bar I visited is called La Gramola, and at first glimpse it was everything I expected from a bar; busy and warm. A busy bar is never bad (normally), it signals that the locals trust the service. Anyway, we ordered coke zero, cazón (dogfish) and a chicken burger. After my review of yesterday I have decided that an overhaul of the ratings system was desperately needed. I have condensed the criteria into five easy to understand factors - appearance, taste, texture, condiments and freshness. And here they are: <img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/20180224_210835.jpg\" class=\"failed alignnone size-full wp-image-18\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Appearance - 2 From afar I had hopes for these chips, but alas, when they were slammed down on the table in front of my wistful gaze, I was already disappointed. Taste 1 - My first taste was bland nothing. My second attempt was somehow even worse. Not even salt. Texture 1 - I can't really describe the texture of these chips. The outside wasn't crispy, the inside wasn't fluffy. It was akin to eating a paper towel. Condiments 2 - Cheap tomato sauce and cheap mayo. But better than nothing I guess. Freshness 3 - These chips had been cooked somewhat recently, maybe in the 10 minutes before they came to me. Overall 1.5 - In all, I think that I would be very unlucky to have worse chips on my journey, yet, somehow I think I will.... Thankyou "

The first being that I eat way too many chips, and the second, that when chips are bad they are the worst thing on earth but when they are great, they can make your life worth living. Today's assignment brings us to Asadero Los Hermanos, about 3 minutes away from my home. A place of consistently high quality, I have enjoyed food rich with flavor and succulent meats. However, as normal, we only care about the chips. Here they are! <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/20180225_143733.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Appearance 4 - Golden. Beautiful. Taste 4 - A truly good chip, one that any self rating food establishment should strive to achieve. Texture 4 - Again, almost perfect. Crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. Only criticism I have is that the chips could be slightly thicker, allowing moor fluffy center. Condiments 4 - A side of store-made alioli gave these bad boys a whole other dimension of flavour. Freshness 5 - I watched them being made in front of my very eyes. A wonderful thing to see. Overall 4 - I think it will be hard to find better in this city. Yet I will continue to search and let you know. Would definitely recommend these chips to anyone. Thankyou "

Even more tragically, those people never got to experience what it's like to eat a truly great chip. This evening I am in the lovely town of Cabra, population 20,000. Events-wise there isn't a whole deal going on. However, what they lack in action they more than make up for with the quality of their food. Location of today: La Casilla. Built some time in the last 800+ years it's a homely place which the locals frequent with gusto. Food made fresh and tasty, I ordered some breaded chicken breast, it was very nice. Naturally it came with chips. <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/20180303_225339.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> When I saw these I wasn't overly impressed. Sure, they look rustic but I've been fooled before. The first chip that entered my mouth filled me with such joy I almost cried. Texture 5 - Absolutely perfect! What the chips of my previous review lacked was density. These chips were crispy and also had a substantial center. I could not hope for more. Taste 4 - They were good. A very strong showing in this department however maybe they could be improved further with some better seasoning. Appearance 3 - As stated earlier, they didn't give a good first impression. Freshness 5 - Piping hot and straight from the fryer. Almost burnt my tongue on some of the larger ones. Awesome. Condiments 3 - Came with bog standard mayonnaise and tomato sauce. Not bad, not great. If you are ever in Cabra, this place is a must go. These chips fill me with happiness. And starch. Thankyou "

We traveled to this restaurant in Lucena to celebrate the birthday of my suegra (technically mother in law but I'm using it). It was a very busy place, so busy that they actually forgot we booked the table. As an asador, they fulfilled my meaty expectations with flying colors but as always, the only important thing is the chips. Have a look. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/20180304_154931.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\" /> Appearance 3 - They don't really look like chips to be honest. More like randomly shaped potato cubes. Taste 4 - Thankfully they had a pleasant taste but the texture... Texture 2 - Most weren't crispy and a large number of them were not soft in the middle. Undercooked. Condiments 4 - A side of alioli was very pleasing, but you can't polish a texture turd. Freshness 3 - I'm not sure how long they were sitting before they came to me. But my hopes in general were dashed on this occasion. Overall 3.5 - I won't say that I disliked them, but there were many things to be desired. However, if you are a fan of big meat, I wholly recommend you visit. Thankyou "

And the chips came veeeery quick. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/20180313_143601.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Looks 3 - As you can see, they don't look bad at all.

One thing that I struggle to understand is how a restaurant, one famous for its food, can be able to produce incredible fried foods, yet, fail at the most basic and traditional foods of all time. The chip. Last night I ate at this restaurant in Cabra. I won't lie, I love this place, the food is so crazily cheap and bountiful, especially the gambas or calamares. Unfortunately this isn't a food review blog, it's a platform in which I trial the most basic food. Here they come.. <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/20180324_230858.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> To reiterate, I love the food, the flamenquin for example was juicy and meaty. But alas I must talk about the thing you're here for. <ul> <li>Looks 3 - They look pretty good, hand cut possibly and the colour is good.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 2 - Unfortunately, they didn't have much flavour at all. They had a faint starchy taste and that was about it...</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 2 - Like many disappointments before the chips had very little texture. They have the consistency of old pancakes .</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - On the condiment side of things provide us with some mayonnaise. Homemade and very flavorful .</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - The chips came out of the kitchen in a timely manner. While they weren't blisteringly hot they were very pleasant.</li> </ul> Overall 3 - Again I want to say the food normally in Malageña is perfect. Yet the chips I must say... the chips were very disappointing last night. Thankyou "

It is a beautiful location... three restaurants along the main part of the busy road and it serves some delicious food. On to the chips... <img class=\"wp-image-41 alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img-20180328-wa0001.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\"> Now don't they look good!! <ul> <li>Looks 4 - I'm not sure if the photo does it justice but the chips looked amazing, they had a lovely golden appearance on the outside and they just looked to die for.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 4 - I thoroughly enjoyed the taste of these chips. The only reason I didn't give it five is because I feel that there was something missing something... I'm not sure what but it was something.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 5 - upon biting into these lovely chips the outside was crunchy and firm. The inside was soft like mashed potato.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 2 - I regret to say that I have to give a low score on this as they didn't actually have any homemade mayonnaise. All they gave us was a bottle of mayonnaise which really didn't do the job .</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - the chips came out in a fairly punctual manner they could be faster but all in all pretty good.</li> </ul> Overall 4 - These chips would be a fine addition to your chip experience collection. I wholly recommend that you come to this place and try them. Thankyou "

In fact, a lot of the food is very nice . I particularly enjoyed the flamenquin. But alas, it's not about the quality of those foods, it's about the quality of chips. And here they come. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-45 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/20180330_151326.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 2 - They don't look particularly cooked... Do they? I had the same feeling on that day.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 3 - Whilst the flavor of these chips was not disappointing, I was disappointed by its lack.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - These chips were not crispy , but they were not soggy. They were unevenly cooked.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - mayonnaise provided didn't taste particularly homemade but it was pleasant. The salt on the chips was also welcome.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 3 - Hot, time between kitchen and table - three minutes.</li> </ul> Overall 2.5 - I removed an extra .5 points because of the unevenness of the chips .

So here we are, the final chips of Easter. At this point obviously I'm sick of eating chips, but I have to give a good go one last time. The restaurant, another place in Cabra. The place is very good... it actually has one Michelin star, so naturally I had to try the chips. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-49 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/20180331_215536.jpg\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> I know that they don't actually look like chips, more like potato wedges. Yet I felt was needed to give a fair and just review as I believe I am a fair and just person . All potatoes deserve love. <ul> <li>Looks 4 - I enjoy things that are presented differently. so these chips really tickled my fancy when I saw them.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 3 - Unfortunately, the taste did not match with the looks. Oh what could have been.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - The chips were ununiformly fried that was some inconsistency of the texture, somewhat crispy, somewhat not.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - As common in Spanish culinary culture, mayonnaise was provided. Was nice.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - I think they were very nice to be honest. Estimated time from kitchen to table: 2 minutes.</li> </ul> Overall 3.5 - A pleasant experience. Short of texture I had nothing to complain about. Thankyou "

So I naturally wasn't planning to eat anything but after the fourth or fifth (hard to recall) we decided that we needed something to line our stomachs. Which brings us to these. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-54 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/20180504_221003.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Cheesy chips with bacon. The deluxe pub snack. Whilst I do prefer the plain chip, I feel there is nothing wrong with indulging every once in a while. On to the ratings... <ul> <li>Look 3 - They certainly look more impressive than a plain bowl of chips, but I knew just from seeing them there would be problems with texture...</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 4 - Cheese with bacon is bloody lovely it is. The chips themselves added nothing.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 1 - Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. It was just a lump of wet greasyness.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 5 - There was HP sauce, Heinz and mayonnaise. Three of a perfect pair.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - They did come out quick. Approx time from kitchen to table: 2 minutes.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Overall 3.5 - I guess they were enjoyable. It's a shame that most of the pleasure did not come from the potato.</li> </ul> Thankyou "

I had been in Madrid the night before so I was very tired and hungry. I was also meeting a friend for lunch, which brings us to the bar of this review. Situated in plaza de toros, it is very popular with its wide variety of tapas. But the chips... <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-57 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/img_20180526_151412.jpg\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1824\"> <ul> <li>Looks 3 - They look alright, but nothing special. A sign of what was to come.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 1 - Oh dear. They tasted like wallpaper paste.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 0 - Had the consistency of paste, too.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - Fortunately, the alioli they serve here is pretty good, so slightly redeeming.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - At least they were hot. Time from kitchen to table: 1 minute.</li> </ul> Overall - 1.5 - I was upset by these chips and I do not recommend anyone to try them. Another day they were 2.5 so it's never amazing. Thankyou "

Yesterday I ordered a Chinese takeaway from my local restaurant in La Chana. Rice with spicy beef which was rather tasty. I also ordered (for some reason) some grilled chicken, which came with a free bag of these bad boys. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-62 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/20180606_2105071.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 3 – They do look like chips, but this is where the similarities end.</li> <li>Flavour 1 – They tasted like cardboard and were an insult to my tastebuds.</li> <li>Texture 1 – Had the texture of biting into a polystyrene cup. Upsetting really.</li> <li>Condiments 0 – There were no condiments. Nothing. No salt. No pepper. No residue oil. Nothing.</li> <li>Freshness 1 – Was only lukewarm. Estimated time from kitchen to table: 10 minutes.</li> </ul> Overall 1 – So far the worst chips I have eaten on this quest and I would not recommend them to anyone unless you enjoy suffering "

Maybe I could recover with the help of some yummy chips? So we went to Nevada Shopping, the biggest shopping centre in that place in the hope of finding something good, and this place seemed like it with its slogan; <i>the authentic taste of Andalucía.</i> Yeah... If the authentic taste was shit. Here are the chips. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/20180609_154136.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 1 - The chips themselves looked ok but what was that on top of them? Looked like dog food (tasted like it, too).</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 1 - As a result, the chips shared the same flavour as the \"meat\" and were not good.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 0 - Wet and horrible.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 1 - I actually put a 2 here before but the place put me in a bad mood so I give it less.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 2 - They weren't that cold. I think the lukewarm meat gave the chips their temperature.</li> </ul> Overall 1 - I will never eat at this place as long as I shall live, and I recommend you do the same. Thankyou. "

I wholehearted apologise and promise that I'll endeavour to bring you immediate updates in the future. Spain played against Iran and it was actually a pretty dogshit match. Oh well, we went to this fairly nice bar in Ancha de capuchinos. Nice meat sandwich, not for a sandwich, we are here for chips. <img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/20180620_2020172.jpg\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-73 size-full\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Looks 3 - They do look nice, but a bit too non-uniform for me. Flavour 3 - They did taste of potato yet there wasn't really that much going for them. Texture 2 - Big Letdown, for something that looked so crispy, it was very soggy. Condiments 2 - A little bit of salt thrown on but not on all chips. Freshness 4 - Straight from the fryer and then left on the side for a minute or so. Overall 2.5 - Average chips, if you are in the area I suppose you can try them out but there are much better options around. Thankyou "

That's a novelty! <ul> <li>Looks 4 - Like I said, they look different and sometimes different is good when you eat a <strong>lot</strong> of chips.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 3 - Unfortunately, they were a bit bland... Not getting much of the flavor of the potato coming through.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - They weren't crispy, but they were at least soft.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 4 - The condiments were pleasant; BBQ sauce and some sort of spicy mayo. Very nice.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 2 - Another disappointment. The chips had clearly been sitting waiting for a long time which reduced the freshness and most likely the crispness too.</li> </ul> Overall 3.5 - I recommend this place, if only for the meat.

The restaurant we had booked (Tanos) completely screwed us over so we came to this place. Which also screwed us over with disappointingly slow service (it took 15 for them to ask what we wanted to drink). As it was a burger grill place, I ordered a burger and standard fries. And then these came. <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/20180714_231102.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Apologies for the photo, it was dark. <ul> <li>Looks 3 - Apart from what they came in (wtf?!), the chips did look pretty good, with good colour.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 4 - They were seasoned very well, with lots of flavours coming through.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 2 - What a surprise. The chips were soft and soggy. I still don't know if they were baked or fried, as they had the benefits of neither.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - They came with a nice spicy mayonnaise, which added a new dimension of flavour to the chips.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 2 - The only reason I'm not rating this lower, is because it <i>is</i> possible to have less fresh chips.. But they were definitely sitting around for a long time.</li> </ul> Overall 3 - <strong>But wait! </strong>This isn't what I ordered! I ordered standard fries, not some sort of artisan potato. So I will take 1 point. <strong>Overall - 2</strong> Thankyou. "

Good cook time.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - On a plate alone, they would have been crisper, but obviously with the humidity from the eggs they were hampered.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - Egg yolk is a delicious accompaniment for chips and it served it's purpose well.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - No grumbles here either, estimated time from kitchen to table: 1 minute.</li> </ul> Overall 3.5 - A good average chip, nothing incredible but very pleasant.

Very pleasing to tastebuds.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - I actually believe that, if the chips were slightly thicker, they would be incredible. But alas, no. Not enough crisp.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 4 - A liberal application of salt provides a great flavour enhancement.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 5 - They were <strong>FRESH</strong>! An absolute wonder, as they were cooked right in front of my eyes. Time from kitchen to table: 15 seconds.</li> </ul> Overall 3.5 - A very good chip and I completely recommend getting some from your local McDonald's (please sponsor me), if they are fresh. Thankyou.

So this was on my second night in England and this location was highly recommended and said the have 'the best chips in Gosport'. We'll see about that. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-95 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/20180816_154922.jpg\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> King Fish. Has been in business for roughly two years or more, don't really know. I got some classic fish and chips. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/20180801_1954141.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 3 - I mean, they look ok, but there's something about their colour that makes me think they've been sitting there for hours.</li> <li>Flavour 4 - I won't lie though, they did taste <i>pretty</i> good. A nice potatoey taste and not bland.</li> <li>Texture 3 - They were very soggy in places and slightly crispy in others. Don't really appreciate soggy chips.</li> <li>Condiments 4 - The application of salt and vinegar was executed well, lifting the flavour of the chips.</li> <li>Freshness 5 - As I watched these chips fried before my eyes, I have no complaints here.</li> </ul> Overall 3.5 - If one is looking to have some chips, this is a decent place, nothing more, nothing less.

The decent thing about this pub ( actually the only decent thing, the beer prices are disgusting ) is the Chinese takeaway next door. This takeaway features chicken in chilli salt, one of the best dishes in Gosport, but as we know, it's a about the chips. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-99 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/20180804_230404.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 4 - There's something very nice about these chips, they look very nice. I think it's the fact they put the same stuff that they put on the chicken.</li> <li>Flavour 4 - Hits of garlic and other automatic tastes give these chips a great unique effect.</li> <li>Texture 3 - Unfortunately, like most Chinese takeaways, they haven't quite mastered the art of frying chips. The result was a little disappointing.</li> <li>Condiments 4 - As mentioned before, the chunks of vegetables made things more interesting.</li> <li>Freshness 5 - Even with a mouth dulled by alcohol, these chips were hot af, so a 5 is definitely earned.</li> </ul> Overall 4 - The best chips from a place that doesn't do chips I've had so far, wholly recommend that you try them.

Energy equals mass times the number of chips squared. <i>Albert Einstein cerca 1952</i></blockquote> Another day, yet another chip review. This time I'm meeting more family members for lunch, and we are hungry and poor. This is where Giraffe comes in; half price burgers? Oh yes. <img class=\"failed alignnone wp-image-109 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/20180814_130050.jpg\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and my sister ordered a chicken burger or something. The important thing to take away from this is: <i><strong>the burgers came with different chips.</strong></i> <img class=\"failed alignnone wp-image-110 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/20180814_1327372.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Looks like it's gonna be a double bill, surprise. So I got the normal chips and it's time to judge them. <ul> <li>Looks 4 - They do look nice, possibly handcut (unlikely) but I do like how the skin is part of the chip.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 2 - As usual, this is the part that always lets down, not a whole lot going on in the flavour department.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 2 - Again, not much going on... They really felt like mashed potato, no crunch at all.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - Fortunately, there were the classic british collection of sauces such as hp sauce and mayo.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 3 - These had been sitting for some time before they came to me. Estimated time from kitchen to table 4 mins.</li> </ul> Overall 2.5 - Not really that good, and I wouldn't have them again. And the next... <img class=\"failed alignnone wp-image-111 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/20180814_132740.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> My sister's look so much better. I think sweet potato fries are cheating though. <ul> <li>Looks 5 - As mentioned before. Look great.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 4 - The flavour of these Sa-weet potats was such a step up from mine.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 4 - Smooth texture inside and fairly crispy on the out, a very good showing so far.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 3 - Same condiments as mentioned before, so nothing new.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - Obviously my chips were sitting waiting for these to be done. Much hotter.</li> </ul> Overall 4 - A lovely chip, and I definitely suggest that you choose this variety of chip rather than the other. Thankyou. "

I thought I would be nice and take my brother to the park for some tennis. 8 mins later we were done and I was hungry yet again. We came here, a place that I had fond memories of years ago. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-114 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/20180815_163732.jpg\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> The fact that the fryer wasn't on when I arrived should have been ample warning for me, but I was hungry enough to ignore it. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-115 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/20180815_124551.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 4 - A nice golden look, with uniformity.</li> <li>Flavour 2 - These chips had very little taste, so little that I hardly ate them.</li> <li>Texture 2 - The chips were sat there for ages before I came in. A very sad performance from this establishment.</li> <li>Condiments 1 - They had been salted. Once. From the other side of the room. Hardly any enhancement.</li> <li>Freshness 1 - Not fresh. Not good.</li> </ul> Overall 2 - Do not eat chips from this place, they aren't good. The best fry? More like the best lie <strong>Hahahaha.</strong> Thankyou. "

That's not right, is it? How do you get chips to be the same size and shape?</li><li>Flavour 2 - They had very little flavour I'm afraid, just a hint of potato and that's it.</li><li>Texture 2 - Again, they really didn't have any texture, just old to be honest.</li><li>Condiments 3 - I believe there was HP sauce and ketchup, but no salt, so can't give high marks for that.</li><li>Freshness 3 - They were warm to be fair, but I think that the chips were being kept on a hot plate, to give the illusion of freshness.</li></ul>Overall 2.5 - Nothing special about the chip.

For two weeks I had been counting down the days until I could finally have the taste of their brie, chicken and cranberry sauce Panini once again but this is a review about chips so enough blabbering on about my Panini. My friend Rachael and I go out for lunch on Friday once every two weeks and as always when we eat at the Bayside cafe we ordered a bowl of…chips. Now this may not sound like much between us however as two college students £2.80 between us as well as out individual meals was all we could afford. My plate however already comes with chips, curly fries. These are not to my taste. Anyway our meals came out with not just one but two bowls of chips?! <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-134\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/45887234_1941720402798002_659662253171146752_n.jpg\" alt=\"45887234_1941720402798002_659662253171146752_n\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" /> There was clearly a mistake here but we were not going to let a free bowl of chips escape our mouths. So there in front of us were three portions of chips to taste. • Looks 3 –They just looked like chips in a white bowl. All different shapes and sizes however they didn’t look very crispy but that’s for the texture to decide. • Flavour 3- From the taste you could tell they were cooked in the fryer. They didn’t taste bad but it wasn’t amazing either. • Texture 2 – Personally the best texture for me is a good crisp on the outside and nice fluffy potato inside. These chips only had a slight crisp if lucky but it was acceptable. Inside however the potato was very dense but also fluffy? • Condiments 5 - There was a variety of sauces such as tomato sauce, mayo and sweet chilli sauce (a big range) jotted around the café as well as salt, pepper and vinegar. • Freshness 3 – You could tell they had just been fried which was good however personally I don’t think they look very homemade and with no mention of them being homemade this is what I shall assume. Overall 3.2 – Not the best chip in the world but it will do for when you get a little peckish whilst out having a walk down the beach. "

It was a nice summer evening and I was hungry for burgers. Enter La Vega. It was a nice place, decent service and the burgers were very nice. Now the chips. <img class=\"size-full\" data-wpid=\"71\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/20180821_212833.jpg\"> <ul> <li>Looks 3 - It's an interesting idea, to do slices instead of regular chips, but I'm not sure it works wholly in this instance.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Flavour 3 - As usual, the flavour of bar chips is at best, average. They really needed some sort of seasoning.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 4 - Nice crisp, and a moderately fluffy center.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 4 - They were very well salted, which is almost all you need in a chip. Almost.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 5 - Lovely and fresh, not a moments wait from kitchen to plate.</li> </ul> Overall 3.75 - Very good texture and freshness, but it's the flavour that let's down.

I thought that smell may have a slight impact on overall enjoyment. However it didn't, so I wouldn't pay too much attention to it. <ul> <li>Looks 3 - They didn't look too bad, just a bit of a mess. Presentation is important.</li> <li>Smell 3 - Smelled like chips.</li> <li>Taste 3 - As you can tell, absolutely nothing special about these. Neither good nor bad.</li> <li>Texture 2 - Big let down on texture, very little crisp and they actually felt soggy. Big no no.</li> <li>Condiments 3 - They came with mayonnaise so that redeemed it slightly.</li> <li>Freshness 4 - Again, at least they were hot so it allowed me to eat them. After all, I was very hungry.</li> </ul> Overall 3 - Slap bang average again. I'm sure one day I'll encounter another good chip but until then, mediocrity. Thankyou "

So here they are: <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-151 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/20190104_144939.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 4 - They do look good I won't lie, I think it's all the spices added that give them a nearly exotic look.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 3 - Unfortunately the spices add very little actually in the form of flavour. Just as bland as always.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - Not crunchy, yet not soft. Needed a longer fry.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 1 - Excluding the spicy salt(?) I got nothing, not even tomato sauce.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - At least they were moderately hot. After a days travel I would have committed seppuku if they hadn't been.</li> </ul> Overall 3. Not worth trying unless you are about to die. I'll be coming back at you with some new chips soon, good or bad. Thankyou "

Well at Christmas time, I visited the place myself, well, the both of us. She recommend that I try the bacon and brie panini, which I wholeheartedly did - with added chicken of course. The panini came with chips. Curly fries. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-153 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/20181228_125806.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> I haven't reviewed curly fries here before, so this is a bit of a novelty. However I must continue to give an honest and unbiased review. <ul> <li>Looks 4 I must admit, curly fries look amazing.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 3 The flavor of the chips were average.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 The chips had the texture of cardboard and were painful to eat.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 4 They had tomato sauce, mayonnaise and hp sauce. Delicious.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 5 The chips came immediately and they were very hot.</li> </ul> Overall 4 these chips were very good, they made me happy. This review is written by student. "

Összesítô... Maybe? I've ordered a burger and it comes with chips. <img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/wp-1561817705479.jpg\"> <ul> <li>Looks 3 - What more can I say?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 3 - Maybe I am becoming Gordon Ramsay, but I really can taste when the chips are frozen.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 2 - Unevenly cooked; somehow they are raw and burnt at the same time.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 2 - I had to order sauces which were decent enough.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - From my seat I could see them being fried, at least they weren't microwaved I guess.</li> </ul> Overall - 2.5O Our next place is called Escobar. It's a restaurant by the river and it's really expensive for what it is. The Hungarian speciality, paprika chicken, was underwhelming. As were these... <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-160 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/20190629_231617.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li> Looks 3 - They do have a more 'handcut' appeal, yet, I can see the under cooked-mess.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 2 - A generic potato taste and nothing more to say.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 2 - Not crunchy, but not soft. Worse than either possibility.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 2 - Came with knockoff Heinz ketchup, had to apply salt myself.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - They were fresh enough to eat. If they had been cold, I wouldn't have bothered.</li> </ul> Overall - 2.5 <u><strong>Day Two</strong></u> Next day we are continuing with the reviews, I have a hunger that is going to be difficult to satiate. But let's try anyway. I'm in a restaurant called Magdalena Merlo. I got some sort of breaded meat, not bad at all. And obviously chips. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-163 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/wp-1561900558854.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> Looks 2 - These chips looked anemic if nothing else. Perhaps my growing discontent of not having found decent chips was starting to lower my ratings further. Taste 2 - They were bland. Somehow didn't even taste of oil. Texture 1 - Soft and pasty. Not a single crisp in sight. Condiments 2 - They were salted, at least. Not that it did anything. Freshness 3 - They were fresh, yet cold. Not sure how that was possible really. Overall - 2 Worst of the bunch I'm afraid. <strong>So, </strong>not a great experience with chips here, which is a shame as the other food was nice. I had intended to find the Buda-best chips but instead I found the Buda-worst. Thankyou. "

Today I am eating in a restaurant that gives a ridiculous amount of food for the cost. <img class=\"wp-image-169 alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/wp-1562590863813.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 4 - They seem homemade... Or do they? Whatever the truth is, they look nice with a golden glow.</li> <li>Taste 4 - These chips are a significant improvement on the chips I had last week. They have flavour!</li> <li>Texture 3 - This was a letdown though, very soft inside but not crispy at all.</li> <li>Condiments 4 - Salted, with alioli as a side. Very yummy.</li> <li>Freshness 4 - At first I gave these a 5, but realised quickly that they weren't actually that not.</li> </ul> Overall 3.75 - A good standard chip that satisfies hunger and taste. Thankyou. "

I'd never been to a hard rock cafe before, but the inside was very interesting. Lots of memorabilia from some of music's best known (but not best) artists. Anyway, the chips. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-204 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/wp-1566051832927.jpg\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1824\"> <ul> <li>Looks 3 - I don't know why I rated these a 3, they clearly look wrong. Not golden brown, but grey.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 2.5 - Did not taste great, I'm assuming old oil.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 2 - These chips were... I want to say stodgy. Not great at all.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 2 - Classic stuff provided; salt, pepper etc, but, did nothing to help the flavour.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - At least they were hot.</li> </ul> Overall - 2.5. I don't think I'll eat chips here again, for the price I paid I'm not impressed. Thankyou. "

They definitely look appealing.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 2.5 - Unfortunately the flavour did not quite match the look. Not terrible, but not great.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - A good crisp on the outside, but slightly too hard on the inside.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 5 - I got three different sauces with it. Mayo, hummus and another sauce made by the restaurant. All delicious.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 5 - These came out piping hot. Estimated time from kitchen to table; 30 seconds.</li> </ul> Overall 3 - A good chip which is overshadowed by the rest of the food. Still worth it. Thankyou "

They soonish look like the ideal chip.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 2.5 - These chips are actually very similar to the English fish and chip shop equivalent. The oil was not fresh so I could taste everything else.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3.5 - Some were perfect. Others had the texture of cardboard so not great really.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 2.5 -They came with mayonnaise. Not 100% sure which brand but definitely not Hellmann's or Heinz.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - They were (re) fried very recently, but the cook neglected to tell me immediately.</li> </ul> Overall - 3 These were pleasant, especially to one as hungry as me...but I'm not sure they would have been as appreciated had I not been hungry.Thankyou.

We went all the way to the top (something like 522 steps... easy) After walking around for some time we find ourselves looking for food. I feel like burgers. So here we are. Comes with chips of course. <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-193 size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/wp-1563711623780.jpg\" width=\"1824\" height=\"3264\"> <ul> <li>Looks 4 - These look very nice. They kept the skins of the potatoes, giving it a great appearance.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Taste 4 - A rich potato smell, accompanied by the aftertaste of the frying oil.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 4 - Nearly perfect, to be honest. The interior texture had the ideal softness. The outside of the chip could have been a little more crispy.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 5 - A platitude of sauces; BBQ, ketchup, mayo and orange-mustard. Sehr Gut!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 5 - They came out very fresh and hot.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Value for money 5 - Came free with the meal so can't complain at all.</li> </ul> Overall 4.25 - The best chips I've eaten outside of Spain so far. Highly recommended if you are in Germany. The burgers are also good.Thankyou "

              "__cdata": " It's a very very very very <strong>very</strong> warm day. My sister and I are visiting Córdoba so she can see the sights (and taste the chips). As a special treat for you we have decided to both write a review of these chips. Let's see who is more generous.... <blockquote>Once again, I Saffron Farrell Horne am doing a chip review. This journey started on the 26th of July when I set off to visit my brother in spain. I have tried an array of chips so finally I have given in to the temptation to write my criticism. Not only has it been hot but it’s hotter while walking so we decided to stop off at Taberna Corredera. Straight away I knew I wanted... Some chips and a Fanta orange so that’s what I ordered. I waited and waited. Sure it might have felt longer in the sun but how long does it take to make some chips. During this time many questions gloomed upon me like will they have enough sauce for me and what the fuck am I doing with my future. We asked where our chips were ‘you haven’t ordered any’. We definitely had. It was clear to see the waiter was far to distracted by talking about his life to everyone and that this restaurant was not off to a good start.</blockquote> <img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/received_2394243223945738.jpeg\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-202 size-full\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\"> <h2>Looks</h2> <ul> <li>Taylor 3/5 - A very uninspiring look. Not golden which shows they are under-fried. As made evident by the texture.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Saffron 3/5 - The chips entered our peripheral vision. I’m not sure what to make of these chips they came out with no salt and they are yellow. This set aside, I can see a crunchy outside which is my favourite.</li> </ul> <h2>Taste</h2> <ul> <li>Taylor 3/5 - They tasted of chips, although the salt tasted nicer than the chips themselves.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Saffron 4/5 - Although i’m not a fan of the other criteria’s I am a fan of the taste. Some are a lot better than others however it could be a lot worse. Also something has to be going for these chips otherwise they’d be pure shit.</li> </ul> <h2>Texture</h2> <ul> <li>Taylor 2/5 - I would say that around 10% of the chips were crispy and about 10% of the chips were still raw. Which leaves 80% of chips average.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Saffron 3/5 - I misjudged. They were soft. Don’t get me wrong it was a nice softness it felt as if i were to bite through a cloud but i am one for crunch.</li> </ul> <h2>Condiments</h2> <ul> <li>Taylor 1/5 - Had to salt them myself, and the ketchup and mayo sachets were warm and awful. Big no no.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Saffron 1/5 - We were given a plate of warm cheap looking sauce sachets. Tomato sauce and mayo. So being me I asked for some BBQ sauce. No. No BBQ sauce. I’m afraid I love my sauces too much and this was a big set back for me resulting in me scoring this a 2. One per type. Later on after trying the sauces which tasted like vinegar I decided to change it to a 1</li> </ul> <h2>Freshness</h2> <ul> <li>Taylor 4/5 - After forgetting our order, they did eventually come out quickly and warm.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Saffron 3/5 - The chips are hot. As I don’t do this often, I can’t tell how old the chip itself is. But what is certain is they were fried (underfried but still fried) within the last five minutes.</li> </ul> <h2>Price/Value for money</h2> <ul> <li>Taylor 1/5 - Well, for the price of €4.50, and the fact they forgot our order, not great at all. These are the quality of chips you would get for free with a meal.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Saffron 2/5 - I think for 4.50€, these chips, the sauce and every thing else could’ve been a lot nicer. Rest assured I will never get them from here again.</li> </ul> <h2>Overall</h2> <ul> <li>Taylor - <em>One point penalty for forgetting order. </em><strong>1.5/5 </strong>I would not eat chips here. Not good.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Saffron <strong>2.6/5 </strong>- I was in the mood for some good crunchy on the outside but fluffy on the inside chips. I had hope but i was disappointed. A normal feeling however throughout my day to day life.</li> </ul> <h5>Thankyou.</h5> "

An asador is normally a good place for food as they use rotisserie ovens for the chicken. For that I've ordered chicken and chips. Well that's just about when everything went wrong. The waiters were lazy, it took 15 minutes to order a single glass of wine and <strong>my entire chicken turned out to be half a chicken. Raw.</strong> Clearly we won't be coming back but let's give the chips a fair review anyway... <img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/wp-1569158104203.jpg\"> <ul> <li>Looks 4 - Ok, they look pretty good.

Would have liked for some of the more natural potato flavour to come through.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Texture 3 - Some crispy, some not. Story of my life.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Condiments 4 - I got alioli so I was happy. Can't go wrong really.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Freshness 4 - To my complete and utter disbelief, these chips came out hot. Considering everything else this must have been a miracle.</li> </ul> Overall 3.5 - I can't believe I'm going to say this, but if you are in the area, you should try these chips. Avoid everything else though. "

Absolutely amazing!!!</li><li>Taste 3 - On the taste side of things they are rather lacking but the crisp(!) makes up for it.</li><li>Condiments 3 - They don't have much salt but there is alioli.

Youare flabbergastered at what you see: Over 652 likes on one of your pictures! There, you can see a a huge amount of likes on your pictures--over 738 on a single photo alone. You put your fuzzy slippers on and head to the kitchen for some tea. After putting on the kettle, you pull out your phone again. Bam! Another 87 likes. And here comes another message. It's from one of your many fans asking about your workout regime, and giving you daps on your sixth official month of going to the gym. The kettle blows and you pour your tea. When you flip out your phone, there's another message--this time from a young girl--thanking you for posting. She follows you religiously and you are an inspiration. As you begin to respond, your cell buzzes again. Oops, another hit. But no time to reply—you’ve got to hit the gym. Listen, taytay.craycray, most people just aren't in control of their life.

Just follow these steps to get a taste: 1. Check out https://rhymbo.site 2. Enter in your Instagram username. 3. Your three most recent pictures will get 10 - 15 likes. Just like that.

This place is a must check out for anyone who visits the city, especially for those of the potato persuasion. It could well be the best place in Granada for \"loaded\" chips, and it definitely was in the past. There is a new guy at the moment and he is getting better, but right now its not <em>quite</em> as good as before. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>I starved myself today in order to pig out on 2 different forms of chip. The normal, and the superb. Lets start with the normal chips...</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[262],\"linkTo\":\"none\"} --> <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/195645419_222264202784726_4658396933765592631_n.jpg?w=448\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"262\" data-link=\"https://chipsreviewforu.wordpress.com/195645419_222264202784726_4658396933765592631_n/\" class=\"wp-image-262\" /></figure></li></ul></figure> <!-- /wp:gallery --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>I should be a photographer with that quality... Lets talk about these then.<br><br>Looks 3 - They honestly don't look great, if anything the photo makes them look worse. But in reality, they do look somewhat inviting.<br><br>Texture 3.5 - They are not the crispiest chip in the world. They do have something about them though... they are at least uniform in their crisp; none of this weird soggy plus crispy combo. All were slightly crispy.<br><br>Taste 4 - Here we go. The chips themselves have a light potatoey flavour and that in addition to the lightly sprinkled salt, they do have a wonderful taste. Add the white sauce and we have a winner, bloody lovely.<br><br>Condiments 4 - The white sauce, as mentioned before, is lovely and it raises the quality of anything it touches.<br><br>Freshness 4 - I saw them come out of the fryer and go in the box. Unfortunately I took some time to take them home and eat so that does have an impact on freshness and texture, of course.<br><br>Value for money 4 - They costed me €1.50 and, honestly, that's pretty good I guess. Its just that, why would anyone just get chips when they could get the chips with meat...<br><br>Overall 3.5 - Can't really go wrong with these if you are peckish for a little starchy snack. I would seriously recommend the next thing however.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {\"id\":264,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/195357427_4103944916337823_3335488385626536038_n.jpg?w=816\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-264\" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>This is the one, the one I get every time I want some chips. It is quite possibly the best fast food here. Chips. Chicken. White sauce, Spicy sauce. Perfection.<br><br>Looks 4 - It makes me happy every time I see this tray of decadent food in front of me. It looks filling. It is.<br><br>Flavour 5 - I said it. It's a 5. You cannot get better than this, or, I haven't quite found it yet. It is the best tasting tray of chips and stuff you can find.<br><br>Texture 3.5 - The texture of the chips themselves suffers from all of the sauce and condensation, but they still maintain a fragment of the crispiness that I so desire.<br><br>Condiments 4.5 - The white sauce is great. We have already established that. The addition of spicy sauce merely compliments the taste further. There is very occasionally a third sauce that they have which would take it to a 5, but today was not that day.<br><br>Freshness 4 - Same case as before, I saw them make it and prepare it and everything, but after taking it home, it was not quite as hot as it could/should have been.<br><br>Value for money 5 - This cost me €6 and it is more than enough for a meal. The €5 tray is probably enough for even the hungriest of people.<br><br>Overall 4.5 - Extremely highly recommended. Try them if you can. Regret not trying them if you can't.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Thankyou</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> "

I guess I would say that number one would be an XXXL shirt I got at a charity shop 10 years ago, which gives me endless room for growth, and my Christmas shirt. When it's Christmas.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"justify\"} --> <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">We're back to the summer now, with another holiday chip feast at the Donner Haus in Glasgow. My sister was raving about this place for weeks before we visited and I must admit that I had high expectations. Imagine our collective disappointment when we found that the menu had changed recently. Oh well, I ordered the biggest thing on the menu and got cracking with these:</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {\"id\":348,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/whatsapp-image-2022-07-23-at-20.34.28.jpeg?w=576\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-348\" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Looks 4 - They do look good, a classic look of supplier-bought chips and fried moderately well. Can't complain about their appearance at all.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Texture 3 - Unfortunately I can still remember that distinct lack of crunch. The inside was fluffy and light but the outside had nothing of note.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Taste 4 - Oh they tasted good though, perhaps it was the sauce, perhaps it was the meat juice from the kebab meat (which was quite bland by the way) but these chips did pack a fair amount of taste power.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Condiments 3 - Garlic mayo and spicy ketchup were decent accompaniments to the chips but the fact that I had to pay extra for them will change this from a 4 to 3.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Freshness 4 - From my vantage point I could see the kitchen in full flow so I could literally see how long they took from fryer to table... which was about 90 seconds.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Overall 3.5 - A strong chip in the end which was let down by the meat that it was supporting. Would I eat these chips again? Probably not.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Thankyou</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> "

Me neither...</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In any case I am back (for now) with some chips I tried in the summer. Who doesn't like summer? The sun is out, the temperature is splendid, and there are always a vast quantity of chips to try. So here we are at the Titchfield mill in, well, Titchfield. It's a quaint little place that falls into the common trap of being ridiculously overpriced due to it looking nice. In any case, lets see the chips.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {\"id\":335,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/image.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335\" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Looks 4 - There is honestly something to be said about the great British pub chip. Long and thicc and always looking appetising.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Taste 3 - Once again (how many times have I said this now?) the chips lack taste and honestly could have so much more depth of flavour.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Texture 3 - Soft exterior with a soft inside. Half of the requirement I guess... </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Condiments 2 - They did provide some sort of chili-alioli, but there was hardly enough for half of them, and it wasn't really THAT good.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Freshness 4 - As a slight redemption, they were at least able to bring the chips out in a rapid manner. Honestly, at this point I would prefer to have slightly colder chips that were cooked well.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Overall 3.5 - Not bad, not great. Would not recommend unless there was nowhere else open nearby.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Thankyou</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> "

I did not really enjoy biting into these things, yet there were a number of good chips in the horde of mediocrity.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Condiments 3 - As mentioned before, they were \"spiced\" with cajun seasoning, but not nearly enough to actually give the chips any special meaning.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Freshness 3 - They were not very fresh, either.

Once again, this didn't happen this week. It happened about three weeks ago now, maybe more. I don't remember. A quaint little restaurant in the center of Malaga that prides itself on using locally acquired foods. A noble effort, but how are the chips? Here they are...</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {\"id\":321,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/whatsapp-image-2022-02-08-at-17.13.36.jpeg?w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-321\" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Looks 3.5 - These chips do have an artisan flair, and I can admit that I was enticed by their looks at the start... until I noticed that they did not have salt on them. Or at least, not enough salt.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Taste 3.5 - They were even rather tasty, I think they were cooked with a nice flavoured oil, that had not been sitting there for more than two years. So once again, this is a nice bonus.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Texture 2.5 - Unfortunately, this is where the quality starts to slip. From the first bite I knew straight away that the chips were underfried. They could have been in the fryer for at least another ninety seconds. Very squidgy. Not good.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Condiments 3 - They came with a smoked mayonnaise, which to be honest was more than welcome. However, the lack of salt and/or salt availability was a damning negative.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Freshness 4 - Whilst they were definitely not fried for long enough, they were taken out of the fryer and brought to the table quickly enough. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Overall 3.5 - They are OK enough, if you are in the area. Maybe they have refined the frying technique by now and you'll have a good time. Maybe they add enough salt and you'll have a great time.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Thankyou.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> "

This time, its my favourite exercises or physical activities. Well, well, well. I think we all know what my favourite physical activity is, don't we? It is, of course, table tennis. I also enjoy going to the gym sometimes when my body isn't made of glass, but that's beside the point. Let's talk chips!</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Back to July and I'm back in Glasgow. Somehow I have spent nearly 300 pounds on food in the space of 10 days so I am trying to cut back on costs, and this is where Nando's comes in. Relatively cheap compared to other restaurants which is great as they give decently sized portions, too. Just like this very large portion of chips:</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {\"id\":357,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://chipsreviewforu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/319382730_931457974686237_767909241806951671_n.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357\" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Looks 4 - Do they look good? Yes, they do. I feel that the Cajun seasoning is somewhat hiding the fact that they are actually anemically cooked, giving them more of a golden colour than they otherwise would possess.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Texture 2 - And, of course, this is where the lack of sufficient fry time comes bac to haunt the chip. Bland textures in my mouth, with not a single crunch to be found. To be fair, they weren't raw, so I guess that's where 2 points come to play.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Taste 3 - No flavour of potato to be found anywhere, but the seasoning once again is pulling all the weight. I would much rather eat these than a lot of other chips rated 3 in this section just for the salty spicy goodness.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Condiments 4 - I believe that Nando's believes that they can get away with poor chips just by having nice seasoning and sauces, and they very nearly can. So many things to choose from, included various spicy sauces, mayo and ketchup. Very nice.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br>Freshness 3 - They didn't seem all that hot, which is strange, because I literally saw them fry the chips. Maybe it was the lack of time that didn't allow the heat to truly penetrate the chip, maybe not, who knows. Not great.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Overall 2.5 - Don't be tricked by this chip, the flavours hide what can only be described as a lazily made potato.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Thankyou.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> "
